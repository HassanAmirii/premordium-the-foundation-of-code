      <!-- the Notes  -->

      <p>
        Have you wondered how a computer understand a human readeable code?,
        Because as you and i both know the only things a computer understand are
        just <span class="color-green">1s and 0s </span>, Take a look at the
        python code below.
      </p>
      <br />
      <div class="code-design">
        <pre class="python-code">
        <code >
        A = 1
        B = 2

        print(f"i have {A + B} apples")
        </code>

        output: i have 3 apples
      </pre>
      </div>
      <br />

      <p>
        The code above is simply easy to understand right, even for a non
        technical person, But this syntax are pretty much gibberish to the
        computer, Because it only understand
        <span class="color-green">1s and 0s </span>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The solution we've got now is to find a way to make the computer
        understand our gibberish, That is, We need to find a way to turn our
        code into
        <span class="color-green">1s and 0s </span>(machine language).
      </p>

      <p>
        Now one of the ways we can convert our code into machine readable
        language is to use a compiler language.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        let's take for example, you are in a restaurant, A waiter approached and
        handed you a pen and piece of paper to write down your order, And you
        wrote :
      </p>

      <br />
      <pre class="order-card"> 
        <p>order list</p>
        <ul>
        <li>sharwama + beef</li>
        <li>a large piece of bread</li>
        <li>honey and butter</li>
        <li>pizza and spaghetti</li>
        <li>a human medium fried liver</li>
        <li>fufu and garri....</li>
        </ul>
      </pre>
      <br />

      <p>
        Now since your waiter here is a compiler, he's going to pile up your
        order list, give it to the chef to cook at once, and bring you back your
        full order, Now that must be pretty fast right, Because all your order
        are processed at the same time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        So basically whenever you are using a compiler language, your code is
        proccesed through compiling into an executable file (
        <span class="color-green">1s and 0s </span>), and it gives you back the
        output.
      </p>

      <p>
        An interpreter language is also another interesting way we can convert
        our code to binary(machine language) We could also use the waiter and
        the chef story to simplify this So again you are at a restaurant and
        approached by a waiter, a pen and a piece of paper was handed to you to
        write down your order • Biscuit • Bread • Yam Now because you are
        dealing with an interpreter waiter, your order won’t be processed at
        once, rather one after the order, That is the waiter will take the first
        oder on the list which is biscuit here, give it to the waiter to
        prepare, deliver the order and repeat, until it finish processing the
        last order, quiet slow compare to the compiler Waiter which processed
        our order at once. So in summary, An interpreter language takes our code
        and convert it into machine code line by line every time we run it
        #TRANSLATION PROCESS So the answer is basically #analysation We’d need
        an interpreter or a compiler to analyze our code for syntax errors,
        #optimization Further our code will the be optimized through better
        structuring so as to use less memory #conversion Once that is done, If
        it a compiler our code will be converted into a byte code, think of byte
        code as a code that support any hardware component, after then it’s
        converted into an executable file (1s & 0s), and for compiler, once it’s
        has converted into an executable file once, it doesn’t have to process
        anything whenever you run it, it just loads pfwee. Whereas if it was an
        interpreter language, our code will be converted to machine language
        line by line every single time we run it #embed that video yt + credit
        or just a link #PROS / CONS: compiler vs interpreter Execution speed
        Memory usage Error handling Debugging and flexibility Use case
        Optimization Real time execution
